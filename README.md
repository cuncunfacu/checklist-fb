# Checklist App

This full stack application lets the user interact with checklists.

I’m currently working on the API integration, but you can [visit a demo](https://loquacious-clafoutis-c9499e.netlify.app/) that loads hard coded data and manages the app’s state with Redux.

## Some of the Stacks Used
+ React
+ Redux
+ Flask-RESTful
+ SQLAlchemy
